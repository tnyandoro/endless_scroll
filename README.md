# Endless_scroll

# Note 
This app is created by using JavaScript for a Page Scroll using AJAX to request new JSON content from and API  If you are looking for a more detailed JavaScript course this course is not for you.  Simple course with limited scope designed to be topic specific.  This course is designed to demonstrate creating a specific topic, the content load on scroll event.  API endpoints will vary with content structure that is returned.  The course is a simple project in response to students who have asked about setting up this functionality.  JavaScript, JSON and AJAX knowledge are prerequisite to this App.

Using JavaScript connect to an API endpoint, load more content into the container as the user is at the bottom.   Using only JavaScript no libraries or other code.
I have also demonstranted how to connect to an API using JavaScript fetch, return content and load that content into a webpage.
